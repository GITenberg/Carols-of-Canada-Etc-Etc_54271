<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> sending forth these gleanings from the later
compositions of my few leisure hours, I take the
opportunity of thanking most sincerely those many
friends who have so generously subscribed for the
work. Not only has their kind appreciation caused
me to realize that I am no longer a stranger in a
strange land, but also, that I possess the whole-souled
sympathy of not a few, in this the country of my
adoption.</p>

<p>Many are the tender memories which unite me to
the olden land: a land for ever hallowed as the quiet
resting-place of the lovèd dead, and the once happy
home of a love-encircled childhood. Still, I cannot
but deplore the many evils existing therein; more
especially that evil of a system which places the
greater number at the mercy of the fewer&mdash;the debasing
system of extensive landlordism; a system
which may have suited in those former periods when
kingdoms and positions were mainly dependent upon
force of arms, but for which there can be no plausible
apology in this progressive, and pretentiously humanizing
age; and if any words of mine shall induce the
tyrant-crushed and woe-oppressed of other climes to
raise their eyes towards the setting sun, and to seek
a home in this Canada,&mdash;this God-appointed haven,
these words shall not have been penned in vain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>I cherish the utmost faith in the future of Canada&mdash;faith
which leads me to look beyond my little day
and view her, with ample resources still developing,
with invitations of welcome still extended, a full-grown
nation of intelligent, enterprising and generous-souled
people, more glorious by far than the world-renowned
empires of the past; a nation unfettered from bigotry
of sect, envy of position, and clannishness of clime;
a nation whose belief is in the eternal fatherhood
of God, and the universal brotherhood of humanity;
a nation whose every act of every day life is the pure
and lofty exponent of a Christly Christianity, and in
whose healthy moral atmosphere vice with its attendant
train of evils cannot exist; a nation upon which,
over all its boundless pasture lands and by its many
sounding shores, the sun of Freedom shines, and the
honest, earnest worshipper bendeth never a humble
knee save to fair Freedom's God.</p>

Ere commerce took its giant stride<br />
<span class="i1">From east to western sea.</span>
From grasp of lordly tyranny<br />

The sons of sires who framed the old,<br />

The red men tracked the hunter's path<br />

With rifle shot he kept his ground,<br />

Yet, what avail his single strength!<br />

With strong, young arm she plied the oar;<br />

'Tis vain! beneath that cataract<br />

<span class="i1">A voice of hope and cheer:</span>

The current bears the slight skiff on,<br />

Saved by that faith-inspiring Love<br />

Though Britain's war-blast sounded forth its warning loud and shrill,<br />
Though Britain's daring rank and file be-crowned the rock bound hill,<br />
Montcalm, undaunted of surprise, with soul to honor dear,<br />
Ne'er faltered in his manly voice, ne'er blanched with heart of fear.<br />
With prompt and steadiest action he ranged his battle plan,<br />
Inspiring with his ardent will the will of lesser man.<br />
Clear ran along the listening lines the order to "Advance,"<br />
And golden eagles waved aloft, and shouts went up for France.<br />

</div><div class="stanza">

Alas for prudent reckoning! sole valor led the way,<br />
And hasted on to conflict dire, whose only succor lay<br />
In calm, reluctant rallying within their fortress walls,<br />
Till compassed of invading tide, till neared the bugle calls.<br />
Unbroken columns moved ahead; with firm, free step they trod<br />
The plain where many a hero's blood would early damp the sod.<br />
Upon their well matched foe they oped with rain of deadly fire;<br />
The British stirred not from their post, but hailed their presence nigher.<br />

Ho! courage of the mariner who dares the fiercest storm!<br />
Ho! valor of the warrior who fears no hostile form!<br />
Yet braver he who stands erect nor bows the craven head,<br />
Though murderous fire is laying low the living with the dead.<br />
Not theirs to flinch, though comrades fell, theirs only to obey;<br />
Their brave young General had said, and who might say him nay,<br />
As manfully, in face of death, he hasted to and fro;<br />
"Reserve your fire till forty yards divide you from the foe."<br />

See Europe's proudest martial powers with rival flag unfurled;<br />
Intent in blood to seal the fate of this fair Western world.<br />
To plant upon those echoing heights that standard which would gleam<br />
O'er sea-wide lakes, o'er prairie vast, o'er forest, mount and stream.<br />
The ancient feuds, the after-curse of many a needless fray,<br />
The jealousies of race and creed revive their wonted sway,<br />
Impart a zest to willing minds, a force to vigorous hand,<br />
And nerve the soldier's arm to fight for king and fatherland.<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>

On like a mountain cataract which rushes to its doom<br />
Of loss amid the foaming surge that sweeps o'er ocean bed;<br />
So more the surge of battle sweep o'er many a noble head.<br />
No further halt! the voice is raised, the expectant order given,<br />
When, loud as if a thunder bolt had rent the vaulted heaven,<br />
Out belched from thousand iron throats a thousand tongues of fire;<br />
Out flashed the British musketry as torch for funeral pyre.<br />

</div><div class="stanza">

The blow long pending, did its work among the assailing host;<br />
Who stood the shock, through blinding smoke could see that all was lost.<br />
Still Montcalm strove, with voice of cheer, due order to retain;<br />
His veterans, by a small redoubt, he marshalled once again.<br />
But vain! ah vain, his arduous task! the stronghold of Quebec<br />
Was doomed to slip from Gallia's hand;&mdash;yet rise from out the wreck<br />
A queenly city on the wave, a beacon on the sea,<br />
Fair monument of Britain's might in Canada the free!<br />

Ere golden beams of noontide spread their glory o'er the sky,<br />
The plain was sodden, far and near, with streams of crimson dye,<br />
And din of battle slackened, save tread of flying feet&mdash;<br />
Pursuers hurrying onward to intercept retreat;<br />
Whilst on the field of carnage, of groans and shattered spear,<br />
The rival Chieftains won their right to grace red glory's bier.<br />

</div><div class="stanza">

Serene of soul in youth's bright dawn, Wolfe laid him down to die;<br />
From strife profound, from mortal pain, peace gently closed his eye.<br />
Whilst Montcalm, loyal to the core, avowed with parting breath<br />
His greatest guerdon in defeat, to die a soldier's death.<br />
True brotherhood of heroism! in God's eternal laws,<br />
One equal spirit ruled their course, however adverse their cause.<br />
And high on pedestal of Fame, where victors bear the palm,<br />
Beside the British General there stands the brave Montcalm.<br />

What task too hard for British hands when backed by British will?<br />
Impelled o'er war-worn field of death, of visage stained and scarred,<br />
Till set against the citadel, a grim, relentless guard.<br />
Out echoes through the silent streets the cannon's dolesome boom,<br />
The famine-struck are fain to feel sure bodings of their doom;&mdash;<br />

Thou mirror of life's history! thou orator sublime!<br />
What sing thy laughing wavelets as they dance along thy shore?<br />
What moan thy heaving surges, as they sway with sullen roar?<br />
Thou tellest to the breezes soft, which fan thy breast of pride,<br />
That pomp and glory of a world once nestled by thy side;<br />
Thou singest, in the purling wave, quaint rhythms of romance,<br />
Of witching queens and warriors bold, of siege and glistering lance;<br />
Thou wailest, in sad monotone, o'er empires gone for aye;<br />
Thou smilest in benign repose upon this freer day.<br />

</div><div class="stanza">

Alone on the crumbling ruins! bowed low his agèd head;<br />
Life's wreck 'mid shattered monuments, sole mourners o'er the dead;<br />

Great city of the salt sea wave, on Afric's burnished shore!<br />
That gleaming wave which wailed the dirge of those it proudly bore<br />
To battle in a vain defense, to sleep the sleep profound<br />
Within no sculptured sepulchre, beneath no hallowed ground.<br />
Great Carthage the magnificent! when Slaughter rung thy knell,<br />
Even from thy victor's war-strained eyes, unwonted tear-drops fell.<br />

</div><div class="stanza">

A fugitive sat Marius; despondent and alone;<br />
Well-nigh forgot of enemies, forsaken of his own.<br />
Where now that voice of terror, those eyes of flashing light<br />
Which awed the Cymbrian jailor, which urged his coward flight?<br />
Where now that haughty form and mien which led the Roman bands<br />
To smite Europa's barbarous hordes back from the classic lands?<br />
Mute are the plaudits of the crowd, seared are the harvest sheaves;<br />
Quenched the chimera light of flame, which gilt the laurel leaves;<br />
Had vanished, as a taunting sprite, those dreams ambition nursed;<br />
The very stones on which he sat were of the gods accursed.<br />

Ask ye Ambition's tortured brain if vulgar hue and cry<br />
The craving of the loftier mood doth fully satisfy:<br />
Ask of keen Avarice if its hoard e'er soothed a sin-fraught breast,<br />
Or purchased peace of mind, or charmed a conscience into rest.<br />
I wot 'tis safer far to bide in calm contentment's vale,<br />
And o'er the placid inland seas to peaceful moorings sail.<br />
Even those whose largess, honest worth doth merit just renown<br />
What are they save the shining mark for Envy to uncrown.<br />

</div><div class="stanza">

Doth muse Oh Marius! on that hour when blasts of martial horn<br />
Across thy peasant heritage through haunts of toil were borne?<br />
When thy young heart throbbed high to join that glittering array,<br />
Which owned thee chief in valor's van through many an after day.<br />
Dost storm Numantia's battlements, whence arrows showered as rain?<br />
Dost stand in thickest of the fight on crimsoned fields of Spain?<br />
Or sittest thou an honored guest, where flows the festive tide?<br />
Thy plebeian birth no barrier, by Africanus' side?<br />
Dost list that certain prophecy that should his race be run,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
The mantle of his might should fall on thee, great Valor's son?<br />

</div><div class="stanza">

Raise up thy head, Oh Marius! look forth ayond the wave!<br />
Yield not to dire despondency; ills conquer not the brave;<br />
Think of thy former exile, then of that glorious hour<br />
When suffrage of the multitude invested thee with power:<br />
When Rome's patricians bent the knee around thy self-built throne,<br />
And all the wills of every land succumbed unto thine own:<br />
Though Envy forged the coward chains which dragged thy scepter down,<br />
It may not wrest from memory thy record of renown;<br />
Arise! reward of courage waits, the dismal night is o'er;<br />
That sun is dawning which will flush thy Civic crown once more.<br />

This day was of his happy life, the happiest, brightest far,<br />

She was no peeress of the realm; no high born titled dame,<br />

To charm the audience with a sound whence dwells no soul of song.<br />

</div><div class="stanza">

So Viscount Edwin sat and dreamed bright dreams of after hours<br />
When the curate's winsome daughter should reign at Crawfurd towers;<br />
And a new, sweet peace stole o'er him as he thought of all the scorn<br />
With which the Earl had spoken of the maiden lowly born.<br />

</div><div class="stanza">

How he had pointed to their sires, and reasoned of disgrace,<br />
While bitter disappointment had paled his noble face;<br />
Then how, relenting for the sake of her long since in heaven,<br />
He'd ta'en his boy unto his heart, and seeming wrong forgiven.<br />

</div><div class="stanza">

Then o'er the dreamer's youthful face there stooped a passing cloud;<br />
But an angel voice made whisper beyond the satin shroud,<br />
As a gentle hand pressed tenderly upon the smooth, white brow,<br />
"I loved thee, Oh my little one!&mdash;I love and bless thee now."<br />

"Dear Cousin Ida! on this day I crave thy special grace!"<br />
The red tide surged in angry force; deep flushed the comely face.<br />
"I may not wish you well," she said, "it cannot come to me<br />
That aught could ever bridge the gulf 'twixt such as her&mdash;and thee."<br />
<br />
Lord Edwin proffered no reply; she was his childhood's friend;<br />
"Come Fido!" to his faithful hound, "our cheerful way we'll wend<br />
Across the park, adown the mead, on to the river's side<br />
Where, 'neath the jasmine's fragrant shade, the glad hours quickly glide."<br />
<br />
Oh! lightly o'er the heart of youth life's scathing breezes blow;<br />
To vanish, as 'fore noonday sun, the first, soft flakes of snow;<br />
And smiles the buoyant hope of youth as smiles the tranquil shore<br />
When Ocean, having spent his wrath, retreats with sullen roar.<br />

At early morn the nuptial peals rang forth full merrily;<br />

The agèd church looked young again, in arch and pillar green,<br />
As through the quaint, old diamond panes peeped in the rising sheen.<br />
<br />
A joyous crowd hath filled the pews; along the sacred walls,<br />
Even as a benediction, the orient glory falls;<br />
The choir within the chancel sit, the organ swell expands,<br />
The clergyman who baptized both will link the lovers' hands.<br />
<br />
Why cometh not the maiden in her crown of orange flowers?<br />
Why linger Earl and bridegroom gay amid their haughty towers?&mdash;<br />
Bring hither cypress garnishing! nor bay nor orange bloom;<br />
For music and for marriage-feast are silence and the tomb.<br />
<br />
With song and voice of cheering the barque doth hoist her sails,<br />
But who shall tell if into port she'll glide with favouring gales;<br />
The golden chalice of the years with joy may overflow;<br />
Drink whilst ye will the sweetened draught, the end ye may not know.<br />
<br />
Upon his couch at morning tide the noble bridegroom lies;<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>

Nor wedding peal will break his rest, nor dawn will ope his eyes;<br />
The violets shall bloom and fade, the river sing its rhyme,<br />
That ear attuned to echoes sweet, is closed to notes of time.<br />
<br />
Still robed in richest evening dress, within her tiring-room<br />
The Lady Ida sitteth, but her soul hath passed to doom;<br />
One line to solve the mystery; one only line, which read:<br />

His mansion, with ancestral lands,<br />

A vast and goodly heritage,<br />

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
